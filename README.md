    3. Loan performance
    
    4. Lending capacity of banks
    
    5. Risk assessment
    
    6. Market trends etc.


DATA OVERVIEW-
    We analysed Banking Loan Data having customer details, sanctioned loan amount, recovery details, interest earned, delinquent loans and NPAs.
  

It involves-

    2.Identifying important columns
    
    3.Treating nulls and missing values
    
    4.Data modelling (connecting tables)
    
    5.Identifying Key Value Indicators
    
    6.Analysing and creating calculated measures/columns
    
    7.Visualizing the data 


Tools used-

    1.SQL to fetch data from the databases.
    
    2.Power query editor to transform the data.
    
    3.Excel to analyse the initial patterns and identify the key performance indicators.
    
    4.Power BI dax to make calculated measures/columns.
    
    5.Power BI and Tableau for visualizing and dashboarding.


KPIs-

    1.Total loans sanctioned
    
    2.Total funded amount
    
    3.Total collection
    
    4.Total revenue
    
    5.Total interest recovered

    2.Histogram
    
    3.Packed Bubbles
    
    4.Tree Map
    
    5.Pie chart
  

EXCEL VISUALS-

    2.Column chart
    
    3.Line chart
    
    4.Pie chart
    
    5.Donut chart


INSIGHTS-

    1.The highest amount of loan is given to the people belonging to the age group of 26-35. The probable reason being the young earning class.
    
    2.'E' grade loan amount being the highest of all grades questions the loan distributing criteria.
    
    3.Default rate is 1.56% which amounts to 11.24M.
    
    4.Hisar, Muzaffarpur, Behror are the branches which are having most number of default loans.
    
    5.'E' grade loans are given on the least interest rates ranges between 4%-8% which is again questioning the lending criteria.
    
    6.Approx. 11% loans are delinquent and are prone to default.
    
    7.Approx. 65% loans are not verified which is not a good lending practice.
    
    8.The maximum numbers of loan amount is sanctioned for home loans.
    
    9.ST caste is having the least share in loans sanctioned.
    

RECOMMENDATIONS-

    1.Bank needs to redefine the lending criteria and should distribute the loans after proper verification.
    
    2.Branches having the highest number of default loans are needs to be scrutinized.
    
    3.ST caste should be represented adequately. We can launch some programme for them.
    
    4.Home loan is the cheapest of all the loans. We should further diversify the loans to increase the profitability.

  SUMMARY-
  
  1. This project is about banking loan data, analysing which I learnt how bank works and lends loans. I further got the insight on people’s banking behaviour and requirements.
  
  2. I got the hands on practice of tools like Advance Excel, power query editor, pivot table, data modelling, Power BI,  Dax, drill down, drill through, SQL etc.
  
  3. I learnt how to perform data cleaning, treating null values and handling blanks, merging tables, analyzing data, identifying important columns and key performance indicators, visualizing the data and dashboarding.
  
  4. I would like to further work on banking data and find insightful information which can help banks taking data driven decisions and perform more efficiently. My analysis will enable banks to improve consumer experience and improve the profitability of the bank. It will ultimately strengthen the India’s banking sector.
